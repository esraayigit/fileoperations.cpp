# fileoperations.cpp
A simple C++ program is an application that takes user input for name, surname, and age, writes this information to a file, and then reads the data from the file to display it on the screen. The program includes a User structure to store the name, surname, and age for each user, utilizing dynamic memory allocation for character arrays to store user names and surnames. It prompts the user for the number of user entries, validates the input for correctness, and proceeds to write this information to a file. Subsequently, the program reads the file and displays the user information on the screen. The code may benefit from improvements in terms of insecure input methods, potential memory management issues, and more effective error handling.
